# Introduction

This article will cover a few different ways of synthesizing populations with two numeric variables, and one categorical *group* variable. First, lets take a look at the data.

```{r dataLoad}
data("grouped2d_pop")
data("grouped2d_sample")
```

```{r popExplore, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = grouped2d_pop, mapping = aes(x = X1, y = X2, color = Group)) + 
  facet_wrap(Group ~ .) + 
  geom_point(size = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE)
```

In addition to the three groups having somewhat different ranges for both **X1** and **X2**, if we tally by group and look at the correlations between the two variable, we see the groups are quite different as well:

```{r popCorrs, echo = FALSE}
grouped2d_pop %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  summarize(
    Amount = n(),
    Correlation = cor(X1, X2)
  ) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

Of course, we statisticians will not get to observe the entire population. In this case, we will get a random sample of size $n = 100$ out of a population with $N = 5000$. Here is that sample.

```{r sampleExplore, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = grouped2d_sample, mapping = aes(x = X1, y = X2, color = Group)) + 
  facet_wrap(Group ~ .) + 
  geom_point(size = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE)
```

And here are the tallies and correlations for the observed sample:

```{r sampleCorrs, echo = FALSE}
grouped2d_sample %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  summarize(
    Amount = n(),
    Correlation = cor(X1, X2)
  ) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

# Method

Our goal is to synthesize populations of size $N = 5000$, hopefully resembling the population, from our observed sample and some assumptions. We can derive the distribution of the population given the sample, using the following: 

>For a population $\mathbf{Y}$, sample $\mathbf{X}$, and parameter set $\theta$, we can use Bayes' theorem to get the distribution for $\mathbf{Y}$, conditioned on our observed sample, $\mathbf{x}$.
>
>\begin{align*}
  f(\theta, \mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{y}| \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x}) &= \frac{ f(\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x} | \theta, \mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{y}) f(\theta, \mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{y}) }{ f(\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x}) } \\
    &\propto f(\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x} | \theta) f(\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{y} | \theta) \pi(\theta)
>\end{align*}

We do have to decide on a choice of $f$, the distribution governing the data. Without knowing any better, one obvious choice would be a mixture of $Normal$ distributions, in which each *group* has its own mean and variance. Note we can combine some of what we learned from both the discrete and continuous cases; we will treat the group variable as $Multivariate Hupergeometric$, so we can use the corresponding theory and prior, and we are treating each group's $(x_1, x_2)$ pair of variables as coming from a $Multivariate Normal$ distribution. This can be represented as a hierarchical model,

\begin{align*}
(x_1, x_2) &\sim 
\end{align*}

Lets write a basic function to create populations following this distribution. 

```{r sampler}
popsim_mixture_normal <- function(obs, N = 5000, samples = 1000, group = "Group", vars = NULL, 
                                  alpha = rep(0.5, length(unique(obs)))) {
  
}
```
