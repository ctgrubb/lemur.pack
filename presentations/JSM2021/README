INCLUDED FILES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This distribution contains 3 LaTeX *.sty files:

* beamercolorthemeHokieColors
    This file defines colors based on the VT Web Color Palette Guidelines. All
    of the colors are defined using RGB values, and assigned to English-language
    names. Note that very few of these colors are actually used in the provided
    theme - they are defined for your use, in case you want to use them on your
    own.

* beamercolorthemeHokieLayout
    This style file assigns the defined Hokie Colors to various aspects of the
    slides, defines the bullet point shape and color for {itemize} environments,
    defines some font colors, etc.

* beamerthemeHokie
    This file defines the inner and outer slide theme, pulls in the Hokie Colors
    definitions, and makes other presentation-wide declarations.  This theme
    file is what enables the \usetheme{Hokie} command.

* png logo files
    These are logo files with backgrounds that match the default background
    canvas setting in beamercolorthemeHokieLayout. Right now there is the
    generic VT logo, and one for Wireless@VT.


USAGE OF THEMES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For now, there is no installation.  Put the style files in your project
directory, and include the  following directive under your
\documentclass{beamer} declaration, but before \begin{document}:

\usetheme{Hokie}


USAGE OF LOGOS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to use one of the logos in your slides, include the following code
between \documentclass{beamer} and \begin{document}:

\graphicspath{{./}}  % Assuming the themes are in the local directory
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.png}
\logo{\includegraphics[height=0.5cm]{vt-logo.png}}
\setbeamertemplate*{logo}

Note that the 'graphicx' package is included by default in beamer-class
documents.


EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The theme provides for a number of feature usage, and things actually look 
somewhat strange if you DON'T use them.  Make sure, for example, that you set 
your organization with the institution command - otherwise, there will be an 
empty set of parenthesis at the bottom of your slides:

\institute{Virginia Tech}

Also, remember that you can easily change the default font of your slides. I've 
found that things look awesome with the Palatino font:

\usepackage{palatino}
